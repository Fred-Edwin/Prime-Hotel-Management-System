## What this project is

**Prosper Hotel Management System** (product name; the client business is **Prosper Hotel**) — a mobile-first web app replacing a Kenyan restaurant + university canteen's manual Excel stock/sales/profit tracking. Two locations (restaurant with the main store, canteen), staff log stock/sales, admin (**WaPrecious**) gets automatic profit visibility. Budget-constrained: **no monthly hosting fees**, ever. This is a single-business system, not a SaaS product — no multi-tenant abstractions, ever.

Full product context (business problem, user journeys, success criteria): `docs/PRD.md`. Read it once at the start of a new engagement with this project, or whenever the "why" behind a requirement is unclear.

Real staff roster:
- **WaPrecious** — admin
- **Janiffer Maina** — restaurant, store manager (`is_store_manager = true`)
- **Sarah Makena** — restaurant, cashier & waiter
- **Mercy Wanjohi** — restaurant, cashier & waiter
- **Anne Gitonga** — university canteen staff

**Local dev setup — hosted Supabase cloud only, never Docker.** This project uses two hosted Supabase projects, no local Docker stack, ever: **`prosper-hotel-dev`** (ref `fbowdsdyccpsumcxcuti`) for development — this is what `.env.local` points at and what the dev server/migrations target — and **`prime-hotel-demo`** (ref `mqtlxuwbjzsjtywhjjtf`) for production. Don't run `supabase start`, don't check for or try to start a Docker daemon, don't suggest a local Postgres/Docker stack as a fallback — it isn't part of this project's workflow at all, regardless of what a generic Supabase project might assume. See `docs/00_ARCHITECTURE.md` §7 for current state. Dev-login PINs for the roster above live in `scripts/seed-staff.ts` (`pnpm seed:staff` to seed/refresh them).

**The human runs all SQL and applies all migrations — never the agent.** The user owns Supabase directly and runs everything DB-side themselves via the Supabase SQL Editor. This means:
- **Never run `supabase db push`, `supabase migration up`, `supabase db query --linked`, `supabase migration repair`, or any other command that writes to or queries either hosted project.** Write the migration file in `supabase/migrations/` as usual, then tell the human the exact file to run (or paste the SQL directly) in the SQL Editor for `prosper-hotel-dev` — never apply it yourself, even to dev.
- **When something needs verifying at the database level** (RLS policy behavior, a computed value, row counts, a function's output) — give the human the exact SQL to paste into the SQL Editor and ask them to report back what it returns, rather than running `supabase db query --linked` (or any `psql`) yourself. This includes `scripts/acceptance/*.mjs` scripts: these are Node scripts that call route handlers over HTTP (`curl`-equivalent) *and* run direct SQL fixture setup/teardown via `psql`/`db query --linked` — the HTTP portion is fine to run yourself, but if a script's `psql()`/`db query --linked` calls would touch the hosted DB, hand the relevant SQL to the human instead of running the script end-to-end. See `scripts/acceptance/README.md`'s "SQL Editor mode" section (add one if it doesn't exist yet) for how a script's fixture SQL should be presented for manual execution.
- This applies to production even more strictly than dev — never suggest or attempt any command against `prime-hotel-demo` under any circumstance; only the human touches that project.

## Project status: phased build is complete — this is now post-launch maintenance

**Phases 1–9 are done and shipped** (`docs/04_PHASE_PLAN.md`, `docs/phases/phase9_context.md`). The app is live and in real use by the client. **Phase 10 (Admin Screen Redesign) is real and in progress** (`04_PHASE_PLAN.md`'s Phase 10 section, commits landed — see git history for "Phase 10 (part 1)" and later admin-redesign commits; no `docs/phases/phase10_context.md` yet since it isn't finished) — corrected 2026-07-24, an earlier version of this file incorrectly claimed no Phase 10 existed. New work should still **not** default to being organized as a phase — phases existed to sequence dependent, multi-day chunks of *new* functionality with their own gating checklists; day-to-day fixes and small updates don't have that dependency shape and the phase-context-file overhead is disproportionate to them. See **"Post-launch maintenance work"** below for how to approach a typical incoming request now.

The one exception: if a request is genuinely large — a new feature area comparable in scope to an original phase, not a fix — flag that explicitly and ask whether it warrants a phase-style approach (its own plan, its own context file) rather than silently either over- or under-structuring it.

---

## Read order, every session

**For a normal fix/update (the common case now):** read `docs/phases/phase9_context.md` once for current repo state if you haven't already this session, then go straight to the relevant reference doc(s) from the pointer table below for whatever you're touching. Summarize back to the human before writing code: what you understand the request to be, which files/tables it touches, anything that seems to conflict with the repo as it actually exists.

**If a request is explicitly phase-scale** (see above), use the old sequence instead:
1. The immediately-previous phase's context file — `docs/phases/phase9_context.md`. This tells you the actual current state of the repo, what was built, what's still open.
2. Add a new section to `docs/04_PHASE_PLAN.md` for the new phase (goal, scope, exclusions, acceptance criteria) before writing code — mirroring Phase 9's own section, which was added this way.
3. Only the reference doc(s) relevant to that work — see the pointer table below.
4. Summarize back to the human before writing code.

Full protocol for how phase context files work, and the exact format to write one in, is below in **"Context handoff between phases (historical — phased build only)."**

---

## Non-negotiable constraints

- **No recurring cost.** Vercel (Hobby) + Supabase (free tier) only. Don't introduce a paid service.
- **Single business, not a SaaS.** No tenant/organization concept, no multi-business abstractions — see `docs/PRD.md` §2.
- **RLS is the real security boundary**, not just UI hiding. Every table has row-level security; staff are scoped to their own location, admin sees both. Verify by testing, not by reading the policy.
- **Prices are snapshotted onto each entry at write time** (`stock_entries`, `ingredient_entries`, `orders`/`order_items`), never referenced live from `items`/`ingredients`/`delivery_locations`. A later price or fee change must not silently alter past profit figures.
- **Two roles only: `admin` and `staff`.** The "store manager" is a `staff` account with an `is_store_manager` UI flag — not a third role, no separate RLS. See `docs/00_ARCHITECTURE.md` §5.1.
- **Restaurant and canteen both track daily — but they're linked, not independent.** (Post-launch conversion, 2026-07-20: canteen was originally weekly; see `docs/phases/postlaunch_canteen_daily_context.md`.) The restaurant sends a subset of items (`items.supply_type = 'canteen_supplied'`) to canteen daily; canteen's daily `added_stock` for those items is a same-day 1:1 mirror of the restaurant's `sent_out` for that item on that same calendar day, not a separate manual input. Historical canteen rows dated to a past Monday (from before the conversion, each representing a whole week's movement) are frozen, not backfilled. See `docs/00_ARCHITECTURE.md` §10 and `docs/01_DATA_MODEL.md` §3.1.
- **Opening stock is never a manual input.** System-populated from the prior period's closing stock — yesterday's, for both restaurant and canteen — never retyped by staff.
- **Ingredients and menu items are tracked separately, with no formula linking them.** `ingredients`/`ingredient_entries` are their own tables, logged by the store manager on `/store`, restaurant-only. Don't build a bill-of-materials/yield calculation — deliberate V1 omission. See `docs/01_DATA_MODEL.md` §3.2 and `docs/00_ARCHITECTURE.md` §11.
- **Wastage is V1 scope.** Both `stock_entries` and `ingredient_entries` carry a `wastage` quantity + optional `wastage_note`, reduce closing stock, and produce a `wastage_value` shown as its own dashboard line — distinct from COGS and expenses. No reason-code enum. See `docs/01_DATA_MODEL.md` §3.3 and `docs/00_ARCHITECTURE.md` §12.
- **Delivery/pickup orders replace the client's WhatsApp process.** Staff log `orders` (customer name, delivery zone or pickup, items, quantities). Orders and till sales both feed `stock_entries.quantity_sold` **without either overwriting the other** — see the concurrency rule below, this is the single most important correctness property added after initial planning. Admin manages a `delivery_locations` catalog (zone + fixed fee); staff pick a zone, never type a fee. No order status/workflow, no rider assignment. See `docs/01_DATA_MODEL.md` §6.
- **Two writers, one stock figure — never overwrite, only increment.** `stock_entries.quantity_sold` has two contributors: `till_quantity_sold` (written only by the stock-entries route) and the sum of that day's `order_items`. Neither write-path ever sends an absolute "new total" — both call `public.recalculate_stock_entry()`, which re-derives `quantity_sold` from its two source numbers inside one transaction. Getting this wrong silently loses a sale or double-deducts stock. See `docs/01_DATA_MODEL.md` §3.4 — read it in full before touching `stock_entries` or `orders` write paths.
- **Order submissions are idempotent.** `orders.client_request_id` + `unique(created_by, client_request_id)` makes a retried "Save order" tap (flaky network, double-tap) a no-op, not a duplicate. Any order-creating route must generate/accept this and handle the conflict gracefully.
- **Auth is Name + PIN**, not email/password or phone. Names can collide — disambiguate with an auto-generated `staff_code`. Internally mapped onto Supabase Auth via a synthetic email (`user-{staff_code}@prosper.internal`) — the person never sees this.
- **No calculation logic duplicated.** All stock/profit math lives in one place: `lib/calculations.ts`.
- **Every table with an `updated_at` column has a `BEFORE UPDATE` trigger setting it automatically** (`public.set_updated_at()`) — never rely on application code to set it manually.
- Don't build anything listed as out of scope in `docs/PRD.md` §2 or `docs/04_PHASE_PLAN.md`'s "What's explicitly NOT in this phase plan" (debtor ledger, trend charts beyond period toggles, formal ingredient-to-menu-item recipes, order status/rider tracking, WhatsApp API integration) unless explicitly asked.

## Design system — mandatory for all frontend work

The design system is documented in `docs/design/`, split into three focused files so a session only loads what its task actually needs:

| File | Read when... |
|---|---|
| `docs/design/00_FOUNDATIONS.md` | You need the philosophy/rationale, or you're touching color, type, spacing, layout, elevation, motion, iconography, or need the raw CSS token block |
| `docs/design/01_COMPONENTS.md` | You're building or styling a specific component (button, input, stepper, card, badge, nav, modal, toast, empty state, etc.) |
| `docs/design/02_PATTERNS_AND_CHECKLIST.md` | You're building a full screen/flow and need cross-screen consistency notes, or a screen is about to be considered done and needs the pre-ship review checklist |

Phase 1 of the build (`docs/04_PHASE_PLAN.md`) implements this system as CSS custom-property tokens (`app/globals.css`, matching `00_FOUNDATIONS.md` §3 exactly) plus a base component library (`components/`, matching `01_COMPONENTS.md`).

**From Phase 1 onward, every phase's frontend work must:**
- Use only tokens defined in `00_FOUNDATIONS.md` / `app/globals.css` — no hardcoded hex colors, arbitrary pixel spacing, or one-off font declarations in page or component CSS.
- Reuse the base components from `components/` (Button, Input, Stepper, Card, MetricCard, etc.) per their `01_COMPONENTS.md` spec, rather than rebuilding equivalent markup/styling inline.
- Run the `02_PATTERNS_AND_CHECKLIST.md` §6 review checklist before considering any new screen done.
- If a screen needs a UI pattern the design system doesn't cover, **flag it explicitly** in that phase's context file as a gap for a human design decision — do not silently invent a new pattern and call it consistent.

### Building a real screen (Phases 3 onward — not Phase 1's token/component layer)

Whenever a phase involves designing and building an actual screen (not the reusable component library itself), work through it in this order:

1. **Adopt the mindset of the relevant domain expert for that specific screen** before writing any UI code — not just an engineer translating `docs/SCREENS.md` into JSX. Pick the expert lens that actually fits: e.g., a POS/retail UX specialist for the till entry screen (`/entry`), a data-visualization/reporting specialist for the admin dashboard (`/dashboard`), a forms/CRUD specialist for the catalog management screens (`/items`, `/ingredients`). State which lens you're using in your plan-back to the human before you start.
2. **Implement the screen** using that expert judgment — composition, information hierarchy, and interaction sequencing — while staying strictly within the design system's tokens/components (this step doesn't loosen the conformance rules above; it's about *how* those components get assembled into a screen, not license to deviate from them).
3. **Self-review the result against `02_PATTERNS_AND_CHECKLIST.md` §6** — both the aesthetic/philosophy checks and the functional/product-critical checks — as that expert would critique it, not just a mechanical pass/fail.
4. **Recommend improvements where you see a real opportunity**, distinct from the "flag it explicitly" design-system-gap rule above: that rule covers patterns the system *doesn't* cover; this is for things the system *already covers* but where a genuinely better screen-level decision exists (e.g., a clearer information hierarchy, a better default sort order, a more forgiving error-recovery flow). **Raise these directly to the human in conversation before moving on** — as explicit, numbered suggestions, asking whether to apply them now or defer — not just noted in the phase context file where they're easy to miss. **Do not silently build them.** Once the human responds, record the decision (applied / deferred / rejected, and why) in that phase's context file for the record — the context file documents the outcome of the conversation, it doesn't substitute for having it.

### Verifying layout/visual changes — the human verifies, not the agent

**The agent does not run browser-based visual verification at all — no `verify` skill, no Playwright, no screenshot tooling.** The human verifies all layout/positioning/visual changes themselves, manually, against `localhost` (explicit instruction, 2026-07-21 — superseding the `verify`-skill-based rule that used to be here, which was scoped to the phased build). After making a layout/CSS/positioning change, tell the human what to look at and what you expect to see (route, element, expected behavior) so they can check it — don't claim a visual fix is confirmed yourself, and don't reach for a screenshot tool to try to confirm it on your own.

This doesn't loosen the underlying discipline it replaced: still reason carefully about *why* a layout bug is happening (inspect the actual JSX/CSS being rendered, not just what a similar-looking component does elsewhere) before proposing a fix, and if a first attempt doesn't hold up, the next move is to ask the human for real detail (a screenshot, computed styles, `getBoundingClientRect()`) — not to escalate solution complexity on an unconfirmed diagnosis.

### Verifying data/logic/RLS correctness — curl only

**The only verification the agent runs itself is `curl` (or an equivalent direct HTTP call) against route handlers** — logging in via `POST /api/auth/login` with a real seeded roster account (see `scripts/seed-staff.ts` for the name/PIN pairs) and reading the raw JSON response / HTTP status code. This is plain HTTP against the running dev server, no DB access — the kind of check that caught every RLS and calculation bug found in Phases 4–6 (a same-day/same-week re-save returning `403` instead of `200`, an oversell attempt returning `409` with the right message, a cross-location aggregate summing correctly).

**No `scripts/acceptance/*.mjs` scripts for post-launch fixes.** That discipline (a saved, repeatable Node script per unit of correctness-risk work) was for the phased build specifically, where each phase was a large, multi-day chunk of new functionality worth a permanent regression suite. Small fixes and routine post-launch work (see "Post-launch maintenance work" below) don't get a new or extended acceptance script — verify with a one-off `curl` check in the terminal and move on. The existing `scripts/acceptance/phaseX-*.mjs`/`post-launch-*.mjs` files already in the repo stay as they are (don't delete them), but adding to that directory is no longer part of the default workflow — only do it if the human explicitly asks for a saved regression check.

**Direct Postgres-level confirmation** (proving an RLS policy itself blocks a query, not just what one route handler happens to expose; setting up a fixture row a normal write path would reject) still goes through the human via the Supabase SQL Editor, never through the agent running `psql`/`supabase db query --linked` — see "Local dev setup" above. Write the exact SQL, ask the human to run it and report back.

**Rule of thumb:** if the question is "did the write/calculation/access-check happen correctly" and it's answerable via a route handler, run a `curl` check yourself and report the result — no script file needed. If it needs direct SQL, hand the query to the human. If the question is "does this look right on screen," describe what to check and let the human look.

**Naming conventions:** `PascalCase.tsx` for components, `camelCase.ts` for utility modules, `kebab-case` for route folders. CSS Modules co-located with the component/page they style (`entry.module.css` next to `page.tsx`), classes in `camelCase`. Database identifiers `snake_case`, matching `docs/01_DATA_MODEL.md` exactly — never rename a field in application code without updating that file. Route groups `(staff)`/`(admin)` are Next.js App Router syntax, not a typo.

**Decision guide for new code:**

| Building... | Goes in... |
|---|---|
| A page only staff see | `app/(staff)/.../page.tsx` |
| A page only admin sees | `app/(admin)/.../page.tsx` |
| A UI piece used on 2+ pages | `components/` |
| A UI piece used on exactly 1 page | Co-located in that page's folder |
| Stock/sales/profit math | `lib/calculations.ts` — never inline in a component or route handler |
| A Zod schema for validating input | `lib/validation.ts` |
| A new Supabase table or column | A new migration in `supabase/migrations/`, **and** update `docs/01_DATA_MODEL.md` in the same phase. Write the file — never run/push it (see "Local dev setup" above); tell the human it's ready for the SQL Editor. |

## Reference doc pointers

| Doc | Read when... |
|---|---|
| `docs/PRD.md` | You need the business "why" — user journeys, success criteria, non-goals |
| `docs/SCREENS.md` | You need the full list of screens/routes, who sees each one, and which phase builds it |
| `docs/00_ARCHITECTURE.md` | You need stack rationale, auth model detail, environment/hosting setup, or the concurrency/orders architectural commitments |
| `docs/01_DATA_MODEL.md` | You're touching the database — full SQL schema, RLS policies, calculation formulas, the §3.4 concurrency mechanism |
| `docs/04_PHASE_PLAN.md` | You need the history of the original build sequence, or are scoping a genuinely phase-scale new addition (see "Post-launch maintenance work") |
| `docs/design/*.md` | You're building or touching any UI — see the Design System section above for which of the three files to read |
| `docs/phases/phase9_context.md` | Once per session (if not already read this session), for current repo state — the last *completed* phase's context file; Phase 10 is in progress but has no context file yet (see "Project status" above) |
| `scripts/seed-staff.ts` | You need the real roster's name/PIN pairs to log in via `curl` for an RLS/data-correctness check — see "Verifying data/logic/RLS correctness" above |
| `scripts/acceptance/README.md` | Historical/phase-scale work only (see "Verifying data/logic/RLS correctness" above — post-launch fixes use a one-off `curl` check instead, no acceptance script). If a future request is explicitly phase-scale, run or extend the existing `scripts/acceptance/phaseX-*.mjs` script rather than writing a one-off check that gets discarded; run its HTTP-only checks yourself and hand its raw-SQL fixture/assertion queries to the human for the SQL Editor. |

## Post-launch maintenance work

This is the default mode now. A typical incoming request is a bug fix, a small feature add, a performance fix, or a scope gap noticed during real client use (Phase 9 itself was three such items bundled only because they surfaced in the same testing session — not because they depended on each other).

**Approach each one as its own normal unit of work:**
- Understand the request, read whichever reference doc(s) it actually touches (pointer table below), and summarize your understanding back to the human before writing code — same bar as always, just without a phase-plan section to point to first.
- Build it, following every constraint in this file that still applies unconditionally: the non-negotiable constraints, the design-system conformance rules, and the verification rules (visual → describe what to check, human verifies on localhost; data/RLS/logic → a `curl` check yourself, no saved script — see "Verifying data/logic/RLS correctness" above).
- **Still update `docs/01_DATA_MODEL.md`/`docs/00_ARCHITECTURE.md` in the same piece of work whenever you touch schema or architecture** — this discipline doesn't relax just because there's no phase wrapping the change. See "Rules for handling architecture/data-model changes" below, unchanged.
- **No new or extended `scripts/acceptance/*.mjs` script for routine post-launch work** (explicit instruction, 2026-07-21) — that discipline is phase-scoped, not a default for small fixes. A one-off `curl` check reported in conversation is sufficient; don't add to `scripts/acceptance/` unless the human explicitly asks for a saved regression check for this specific piece of work.
- Commit with a message that describes the fix; push when the human confirms (per this file's own git-safety norms — don't push unprompted beyond what's already been agreed for a session).
- **No phase-context file is required.** A commit message and, if the fix involved a genuinely non-obvious root cause or a real judgment call, a note in the relevant doc's surrounding comments (see the `users.active`/PIN-length example in `01_DATA_MODEL.md`, added Phase 9) is enough of a record. Don't manufacture a `docs/phases/phase10_context.md`-style file for a routine fix.
- If a fix reveals something that contradicts a documented decision or a "known issue" from a prior phase context file, **don't edit that old file** (same rule as always — it's a diary, not a wiki) — correct it going forward in the doc that's actually still authoritative (`01_DATA_MODEL.md`/`00_ARCHITECTURE.md`) and mention the correction to the human.

---

## Context handoff between phases (historical — only if a request is explicitly phase-scale)

This section describes the protocol Phases 1–9 used. It no longer applies to routine work (see "Post-launch maintenance work" above) — kept only for the rare case of a future phase-scale addition.

**Each completed phase writes its own standalone file**: `docs/phases/phase1_context.md`, `phase2_context.md`, and so on.

### The rule: only the immediately-previous file is required reading

A session starting Phase N reads `docs/phases/phase{N-1}_context.md` — not the entire chain back to Phase 1. This keeps each session's required reading small and bounded as the project grows. The tradeoff: **anything from an earlier phase that's still load-bearing must be explicitly carried forward** by every phase's context file in between, not just described in its own scope. If Phase 2 made a decision Phase 6 needs to know, Phases 3, 4, and 5's context files must each re-state it (even briefly) as still-relevant — don't assume it survives silently just because it's true.

### What every `phaseX_context.md` must contain

```markdown
# Phase X — [name] — [date]

**Status:** Complete | Partial | Blocked

**What was built:**
- Specific bullet list — file names, features, migrations. Not vague summaries.

**Deviations from the phase plan:**
- Anything done differently than `04_PHASE_PLAN.md` specified, and why. "None" if nothing deviated.

**Gating checklist results:**
- Confirm each item from `04_PHASE_PLAN.md`'s standard gating checklist explicitly (tests pass, build passes, CI green, design-system conformance, RLS re-verified, deviations documented, design-system gaps flagged) — pass/fail per item, not a blanket "done."

**Challenges faced:**
- Anything that was harder than expected, any bug that took real effort to track down, any ambiguity that had to be resolved with a judgment call.

**Known issues / tech debt left behind:**
- Anything knowingly imperfect, deferred, or stubbed out.

**Carried forward from earlier phases:**
- Anything from Phase 1..N-1's context files that's still load-bearing for future phases — restate it here, don't assume it's still visible.

**Instructions for the next phase:**
- Anything the next phase specifically needs to know that isn't obvious from the docs alone.
```

### Rules
- **Never edit a previous phase's context file.** If something from an earlier phase turns out to be wrong, note the correction in the current phase's file — the record should read like a diary, not a wiki.
- **A phase is not done until its context file exists and its gating checklist is honestly filled in.** Don't write "Complete" if a checklist item actually failed — write "Partial" or "Blocked" and say exactly what's missing.
- **If a phase's acceptance criteria genuinely can't be met** (a dependency doesn't exist, a prior phase left something broken), stop and report — log it as "Blocked," don't work around it silently.
- **At the end of each phase, push the code to the GitHub `main` branch** (commit the phase's changes, including its `docs/phases/phaseX_context.md`, then `git push origin main`) and confirm the CI run is green (`gh run list --branch main --limit 1`) before considering the phase done.

## Rules for handling architecture/data-model changes mid-project

1. **Don't silently deviate in code while leaving the docs saying something else.** This is the most damaging failure mode for a multi-session project — the docs become lies, and every future session inherits false context.
2. Update the relevant doc (`docs/00_ARCHITECTURE.md` or `docs/01_DATA_MODEL.md`) directly, in the same phase where the change happens.
3. Note the change explicitly in that phase's context file, including the *reason*.
4. If the change affects future phases described in `docs/04_PHASE_PLAN.md`, update that file too and say so in the context file — don't let the plan and reality quietly diverge.
5. **Don't re-litigate settled decisions** (e.g., "should we use Tailwind instead?") unless the current phase's spec explicitly asks you to revisit it, or something has genuinely broken that traces back to that decision.
6. **Don't invent new tables, routes, or major structure** not described in `docs/01_DATA_MODEL.md` or this file's Project Structure section, without flagging it as a proposed change and updating those docs.
7. **Prefer finishing a phase's stated scope over gold-plating.** If time/context remains after meeting acceptance criteria, propose additions in the context file's "Instructions for the next phase" rather than silently building them.

## When something doesn't add up

If `docs/04_PHASE_PLAN.md` conflicts with the immediately-previous phase's context file, or a reference doc seems out of date with the actual repo — stop, flag it in your summary-back to the human, and update the doc rather than silently working around the mismatch.

If asked to draft a prompt by the user, always include the relevant role, and never draft the prompt as a file.

The user prefers that when you use a tasklist that you update as you progress when you are working on something so he can observe the progress.

Always use pnpm.
